# Display Multiple Axes Using D3 Animations
## Background
This project compares data from 2014 American Community Survey 1-year estimates on average economic values by state.  The deployed visualization allows the user to compare any of healthcare, obesity, or smoking percentages with any of poverty percentages, age, or household income.

## Process
After gathering the required [data](assets/data/), I used D3 to create a scatterplot of each state's data.  This allows the visualization to associate each point on the scatterplot with the appropriate data set.  The user can select a particular axis to view, and the plot will update the data with animation indicating how the data visualization has changed.

## Results
Since I am specifically analyzing data from 2014, the data visualizes predictable trends.  I have also included a brief description of noticeable correlations that updates along with each comparison.
